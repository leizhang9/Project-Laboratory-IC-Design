# Project Laboratory IC-Design

## Description

During the course of the lab, a central building block of a radio-controlled multi-functional clock
shall be implemented. It should be compatible with the time signal used by the DCF77 transmitter
in Mainflingen near Frankfurt/Main. In order to solve the task in a reasonable amount of time, only
clock-specific functions need to be implemented. The peripherals of the design are fixed, while some internal functional blocks are already given to be used in
the system.
As a result of the lab, the individual functional blocks have to be integrated to form a single VHDL
model that may be synthesized and ported onto the Xilinx Zynq-7000 (XC7Z020-3CLG484)
FPGA.
